# talkshow_guests

### Project description

In this project I use data on politicians who have appeared on five American Sunday news and talk shows: “Meet the Press,” “Face the Nation,” “This Week,” “Fox News Sunday” and “State of the Union.” By doing this I investigate the question whether different talk shows favor specific parties by offering more screen time to their representatives.  

### Hypothesis

1. Different talk shows favor guests from different parties. More specifically: The proportion of talk show guests from the different political parties is different for each talk show.

2. The proportion of talk show guests from the different political parties in each show changes over time (years: 2009 - 2014).

### Approach

To test hypothesis 1, I will graphically and numerically summarize the total proportions of guests from different parties for all 5 shows. To do this I will report the proportions in a markdown table and visualize them using a stacked bar plot. To test hypothesis 2, I will track the proportions over time and present them in a table as well as a time plot .
